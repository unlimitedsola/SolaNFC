# NFC Scripts

This folder is where you work with your scripts. The structure of this folder is as follows:

- `lib`: For common code that can be shared among all scripts.
- `sample`: For sample scripts that you can use as a reference.
- `user`: For your own custom scripts.

The highlighting and code-completion should work out of the box. If you want to add more libraries, you can add them to
the `build.gradle.kts` file.
